## Scaling Continous Features

* If we have features whose units and ranges are different. Model may give more importance to one over other. 
* So we can scale them using various techniques to bring them to same range so that make model can give same importance.
* Types of scaling:
  * **Min - Max** (Normalization) - brings the values to range 0-1

  * **Standard scaling** (Z - values) - calculates z values using mean and standard deviation.
