### Histogram
* range of data is divided into bins and items belonging to same bin are piled on each other.
* In a chart we can have x_axis as the range of data. Y-axis as No. of units(heights) belonging to each bin.
* Histogram is a good representation of get a idea about distribution of data.
* It was introduced by Karl Pearson.

### Statistical Distribution
* Distribution is a table or function showing the possible values of a varibale and how often(probability) they occur.
* For a continous variable if we make histogram bins small and draw curve to aprroximate it. The curve is appoximate distribution of data.
* Curve can be used to calculate probabilties between various possible values.
* There are various eastablished distributions which many datasets follow. Ex. Normal distribution

### Normal Distribution

* It is a function describing type of distribution which approximates many real world variables.
* Data is centered around mean. 66% data is present mean+sd and mean-sd, 95% present between mean+2sd amd mean-2sd, 99% between mean+3sd and mean-3sd

### Population Parameters
* All the outcomes together for variable is called population.
* Statistics of poulation are called population parameters. 
* If a poulation is represented by normal distribution, Mean and standard deviation are parameters of population.
* It is rare for us to measure everything in poulation so we use sample statistics to estimate population parameters.
* More data we have more confidence we have in populaiton estimates. 
* We general calculate p-values or confidence intervals for population estimates which tell how much confidence we have in the estimates.
* we can also use p-values and confidence intervals to see how different are two samples
* Poplulation variance - sum((x-mean_x)^2)/n_x
* Population sd = sqrt(variance)
* variance and standard devation give how varied data is from mean.
* Estimated poulation variance from sample: sum((x - x_sample_mean)^2)/(n_x-1)
* Estimated poulation sd = sqrt(estimated_pop_var)
* estimated poulation mean = sample mean
* Model is a way to explore relationship between variables. It is a equation which is approximation of relationship.
* Model statstics tell us how good or bad approximation is. Model can be simple or complex.
