* Model Under-fitting - High bias
* Model Over-fitting - High Variance
* If a model has high bias, high variance - Model is not fitting data properly but overfitting on some parts of the data
* Examples - train Error: 1%,Dev error - 11% - High Variance
* Train Error: 15%, Dev error: 16% - High Bias
* Train Error: 15%,Dev error:30% - High Bias, High Variance
* Train Error: 3%, Dev error: 4% - Low bias, Low Variance (Ideal Model)
