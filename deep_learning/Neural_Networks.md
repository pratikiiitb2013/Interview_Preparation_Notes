## Introduction

* Neural networks are network like structres composed of neurons where each single neuron performs a simple mathematical computation.
* You can think of whole neural network like a complex function which takes in some input data performs mathametical operations on them and spits out output values.
* Each neural network contains nodes(Neuron) and connecions between them. Each connection has a parameter value (weight) which is similar to slope in regression.
* We start with random weights and update them based on fitting the input and ouput data,
* Our aim is to calculate the optimal weights such that whole network approximates relation ship between input and output data.
* layers of nodes between output and input nodes are called hidden layers.
* At each node inputs coming inside are multiplied with respective weight of connection and summed up, bias is added and put into a function called activation function.
* Activation function decides how much of input to pass on to the next layer. We have multiple activation functions, which are discussed below.
